> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Early Access Notice**
>
> **Kokoro Engine** is currently in **Alpha Development Stage**.
>
> This is an open-source project built by a single developer with limited resources (primary development machine is just an RTX 4060 laptop).
>
> - **🚧 Not Ready Out-of-the-Box**: Features are still iterating frequently and may require some technical background to configure.
> - **💸 Funding & Testing Limitations**: Due to limited funds, **apart from LLM interfaces, other commercial APIs have not been fully tested**. Although the code is implemented, there is no guarantee that all commercial APIs will work perfectly.

## ✨ Introduction

**Kokoro Engine** is a cross-platform virtual character immersive interaction engine designed to let everyone have a "heartfelt" virtual companion on their desktop (inspired by Neuro-sama).
It integrates technologies such as Live2D, LLM, TTS, and STT to build a highly modular and customizable interaction system.

## ✅ Features

Features currently verified mainly in a local environment (RTX 4060 Laptop):

### 🎭 Core Interaction
- **Live2D Models**: Full support for Live2D Cubism SDK, supporting eye tracking and motion triggering.
- **Model Hot-Switching**: Supports real-time import and switching of different Live2D models and viewing angles within the app.
- **Multi-language Interface**: Full Internationalization (I18n) support, currently supporting **Simplified Chinese**, **English**, **Japanese**, and **Korean**.

### 🧠 AI Brain
- **Multimodal Conversation**: Supports **Ollama** (Local) and **OpenAI Compatible Interfaces** (Cloud) as the conversation core.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Can integrate Vision models, supporting **screen capture** or **image upload**, allowing the character to "see" and describe the content.
- **Text-to-Image**: Can integrate Stable Diffusion WebUI or online API interfaces, supporting image generation via dialogue or generating real-time background images based on conversation context.
- **Tiered Memory System**: Features a three-layer memory architecture — tiered memory (core facts never forgotten, ephemeral memories naturally decay), hybrid semantic + keyword retrieval (embedding cosine similarity + FTS5 BM25 with RRF rank fusion), and LLM-driven automatic memory consolidation (similar fragmented memories are clustered and merged). Automatically extracts key facts from conversations for long-term storage (SQLite), with real-time context recall and emotion persistence.

### 🗣️ Voice Interaction
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
    - **GPT-SoVITS**: Excellent emotional expressiveness, custom character voices, and a richer ecosystem.
    - **Browser TTS**: Lightweight browser-native TTS.
- **Voice Conversion (RVC)**: Supports RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) interface for implementing character singing.
- **Voice Interaction (STT)**: Initial support for Whisper/faster-whisper/whisper.cpp models.

### 🔌 Extended Capabilities
- **MOD System**: Built-in modular MOD framework that allows replacing core UI components (chat panel, settings panel, etc.) with custom HTML/CSS/JS, with support for custom themes and a QuickJS script sandbox.
- **MCP Protocol Support**: Implements **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** Client.
    - Supports connection to any MCP Server (via stdio interaction).
    - Characters can use tools provided by MCP Servers (such as file system, Web search, databases, etc.) to enhance capabilities.
    - Supports managing MCP Servers via UI.
- **Telegram Bot Remote Interaction**: Built-in Telegram Bot service for chatting with your character from your phone — no public IP required.
    - Supports text, voice, and photo messages, bridging to the full LLM/TTS/STT/ImageGen pipeline.
    - Chat ID whitelist access control, session commands (`/new`, `/continue`, `/status`).
    - Desktop chat UI syncs Telegram messages in real-time.

### 🎮 Official Demo MOD: Genshin Impact Style UI

The project includes a complete official demo MOD (`mods/genshin-theme`) that redesigns the chat and settings interfaces in the visual style of Genshin Impact:

- Fully replaces the chat and settings panels with complete feature parity
- Includes character management, LLM/TTS/STT/Vision/ImageGen configuration, MCP management, background settings, memory management, and all other settings
- Serves as a reference template for community developers creating custom UI MODs

## 📝 TODO / In Development

The following features are planned, in development, or **not yet tested/verified due to device or funding limitations**:

- [ ] **Deep Testing of Online Services**: Verify more commercial APIs besides LLM (e.g., Azure TTS, Google STT, etc.).
- [ ] **Mobile Support**: iOS / Android client applications.
- [x] **Tiered Memory System**: Tiered memory (core/ephemeral), hybrid retrieval (semantic + BM25 RRF fusion), and LLM-driven memory consolidation.
- [x] **MOD Plugin System**: Allow community developers to write MOD modules to extend functionality (HTML/CSS/JS + QuickJS script sandbox).
- [x] **Live2D Model Interaction**: Real-time interaction feedback with Live2D models (eye tracking, motion triggers, expression sync).
- [ ] **Character Market/Workshop**: Facilitate sharing and downloading character presets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| **Backend** | Rust (Tauri v2) |
| **Rendering** | PixiJS + Live2D Cubism SDK |
| **Data** | SQLite (Local Storage) |

> **🚀 Why Rust?**
>
> Thanks to the amazing performance of the Rust language, Kokoro Engine has **extremely low memory usage** and **extremely high execution efficiency**.
> Even running 24/7 in the background, it won't slow down your system, truly achieving "lightweight" companionship.
